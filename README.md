# README - Cybersecurity Attacks Dataset Analysis

---

## Project Overview  
This project involves the exploration and analysis of the **Cybersecurity Attacks Dataset** obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teamincribo/cyber-security-attacks). The dataset provides detailed information on various cyber-attacks, including timestamps, attack types, and related metadata.

## Dataset Description  
The dataset contains **25 columns**, each describing specific attributes of cyber-attacks. Below is a description of the columns:  
- **Timestamp**: The time when the attack occurred.  
- **Name**: Name of the attack.  
- **Attack_Type**: The type of attack (e.g., DDoS, SQL Injection).  
- **Source_IP**: The IP address of the attacker.  
- **Target_IP**: The IP address of the target system.  
- **Port**: Targeted port number.  
- **Protocol**: Protocol used (e.g., HTTP, TCP).  
- **Size**: Size of the attack (in bytes).  
- **Country**: Country of origin of the attacker.  
- **City**: City of origin of the attacker.  
- **ISP**: Internet Service Provider of the attacker.  
- **Method**: The method used to execute the attack.  
- **App**: The application or service involved.  
- **Log_Type**: Type of log recorded.  
- **Detection**: Indicates whether the attack was detected.  
- **User_Agent**: Browser or application information.  
- **Response_Code**: Response code returned by the server.  
- **Device**: Type of device targeted by the attack.  
- **Payload**: Data or payload transmitted during the attack.  
- **Action**: Action taken after the attack.  
- **Risk_Level**: Risk level associated with the attack.  
- **Source_Port**: Port number used by the attacker.  
- **Destination_Port**: Port number on the target system.  
- **Duration**: Duration of the attack.  
- **Extra_Info**: Additional information about the attack.  

This dataset offers comprehensive details for studying attack patterns and crafting detection strategies.

## Steps Performed  

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - The dataset was imported into a Pandas DataFrame.  
   - Missing values were identified and addressed:  
     - **Categorical columns**: Filled using the **mode**.  
     - **Numerical columns**: Filled using the **mean** or **median**.  
   - Outliers were detected and appropriately handled to ensure data consistency.  

### 2. **Variable Analysis**  
   - Detailed descriptive analysis of **numerical** and **categorical** variables.  
   - Unique and frequent values were examined for all columns.  
   - Relationships between variables were explored using statistical measures such as correlation.  

### 3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Key insights were extracted using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** visualizations:  
     - **Histograms**: To analyze the distribution of numerical variables.  
     - **Bar Charts**: To visualize frequencies of categorical variables.  
     - **Box Plots**: For detecting and analyzing outliers.  
     - **Correlation Heatmaps**: To examine the relationships between numerical variables.

## Future Steps: Model Training  

If this dataset were to be used for model training, the primary objective would be to build a **classification model** to predict the type of cyber-attack based on the given features.

### Proposed Model: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Why Random Forest?**  
  - Handles both numerical and categorical data efficiently.  
  - Robust against overfitting due to its ensemble learning approach.  
  - Capable of modeling complex relationships within the data.  

### Steps for Implementation:  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Apply necessary feature engineering techniques.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Train the Random Forest model using the training dataset.  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as:  
     - **Accuracy**  
     - **Precision**  
     - **Recall**  
     - **F1-score**  
     - **ROC-AUC**  

This approach ensures a reliable and scalable model for cyber-attack classification.
